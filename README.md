# orders-management

- Just wrote a script to find the details for all the orders placed on Zomato.

## Instrustions

- file_path should contain response of every order history page separated by newline operator

## Analysis

Other interesting signals that I found :

- Ordered the least on Wednesdays & Thursdays (10.2% each).
- Ordered dinner the most (51.0%)
- Ordered the most in the month of October (14.3%, pre holiday season?)
- Ordered the least in the month of January (4.8%, post holiday season?)
- Ordered non-veg 33.1% of the times
- Ordered from rating > 4.0 restaurants 74.8% of the times
- Could have hired a semi-professional chef for 14 months and eaten much better food for the entire day

## Outcome

- [Google Sheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAyICC0H02t25bYuUyQ2bwR_jWSRgUZfCEtzu-aeobo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project expense

- Surprisingly, I have spent ₹122,970.82 in a span of 14 months (₹8783.63 per month).

## Candide expectation

- Wish all the marketplaces like Flipkart, Amazon, Swiggy, etc. shared the expenditure of their users having kept the expectation of reduced user retention (which can easily be countered).
